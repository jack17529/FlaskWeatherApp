# FlaskWeatherApp

- Developed a flask app using Python3, SQLalchemy and deployed it on Kubernetes.
- Used Jenkins servers on AWS for CI/CD pipeline.
- Provisioned the architecture on AWS using Terraform.
- Did configuratin management of Jenkins servers on AWS using Ansible.
- Deployed the app on EKS cluster using helm chart.

## Steps to run the flask app

1. Clone the git repo.
2. Create a python virtual environement.
3. Install the `requirements.txt` in the environement.
4. Use the sample `config.ini` and `secret.ini` provided below to run the app.

```ini
[main]
DEBUG = True
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = sqlite:///weather.db
SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
```

```ini
[main]
api_key = 271d1234d3f497eed5b1d80a07b3fcd1
```

5. Run the app using `flask run` command.

## Steps to run Dockerfile

1. Clone the git repository.
2. cd in the repository and build the Dockerfile using `docker build -t <name of image you want to build>:<tag> .`
(example - `docker build -t flaskapp:latest .`)
3. Check the images present using `docker images`
4. Run the Dockerfile using `docker run -d -p <port_to_be_served>:<port_the_website_works> <name of image you want to build>:<tag>`
(example - `docker run -p 5000:5000 flaskapp:latest`)
5. Go to localhost:5000
6. The docker image can be found on Docker Hub - https://hub.docker.com/r/jack17529/weather

## Steps to deploy

1. Make a deployment.yaml file
2. The file has 2 parts the deployment part and the service part.
3. Make a namespace for the app `kubectl create ns flaskapp`
4. Deploy using `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -n flaskapp`
5. Check port`31000` and the weather app would be running.

## Setting up AWS

Infrastructure provisioning with Terraform and configuration management with Ansible.
Using aws-vault for keeping secrets.

## Setting Jenkins Pipeline

Set up jenkins pipeline with 3 jobs which are triggered from github webhook. Used Jenkins master and two slave servers on AWS.  
Tested the backend on staging server then deployed it in production using Jenkins Pipeline.
